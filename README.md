# Python Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains examples of my work using Python (and Excel) for data analysis.

## Files

- **Stor 320.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook from a class project where I used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) to analyze datasets.  
  - Imported tables from Excel into Python  
  - Cleaned and transformed the data  
  - Created visualizations to identify trends  

- **linked_list.py**  
  Python script implementing a recursive linked list as part of a data structures assignment.  
  Demonstrates problem-solving, algorithm design, and use of Python for object-oriented programming.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and manipulation with Python & Excel  
- Visualization with Matplotlib  
- Working with structured data (CSV/Excel imports)  
- Python programming fundamentals and data structures  

This repository highlights my ability to work with both **large datasets** and **algorithmic coding challenges**, showing versatility across analytics and programming tasks.
